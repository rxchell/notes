Instead, please work with the operations available in NumPy. \n",

    "Our last task is to implement `is_peak`. This function takes `n_cases_increase_avg` and `n_adj_entries_peak` as arguments, and **determines whether the $(j + 1)$-th day was a day when the increase in cases peaked in the $i$th country**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, `n_cases_increase_avg` is given by `average_increase_in_cases(n_cases_increase, n_adj_entries_avg)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose `a` is the average daily increase in cases, with the $(i, j)$ entry indicating the **average increase** in cases on the $(j + 1)$-th day in the $i$-th country. Moreover, let `n_adj_entries_peak` be denoted by `m`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, an increase on the $(j + 1)$-th day is deemed *significant* in the $i$-th country if `a[i, j]` is greater than 10 percent of the mean of all **average daily increases** in the country. `np.nan` is, as the name suggests, not a number and cannot contribute to the mean. Therefore, if we have the set $\\{2, 3, `np.nan`\\}$, the mean should be $(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, to determine whether there is a *peak* on the $(j + 1)$-th day in the $i$-th country, check whether `a[i, j]` is *maximum* in`(a[i, j - m], a[i, j - m + 1], ..., a[i, j + m - 1], a[i, j + m])`. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the event that there are non-unique values such that there exists some value `a[i, k] = a[i, j]`, where $k \\neq j$ and $j - m \\leq k \\leq j + m$, we consider `a[i, j]` a maximum if and only if $k > j$. For example, in $(5, 10, 10)$, 10 is considered a maximum (since the second 10 appears to the right of the value 10 in the middle); but in $(10, 10, 5)$, 10 is not considered a maximum (since there exists another 10 to the left of the value in the middle).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, **if `a[i, j]` is maximum and significant, then there is a peak on the $(j + 1)$-th day in the ith country; otherwise, there is no peak.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the return value of this function should be a 2D `np.ndarray` with the $(i, j)$ entry indicating whether there is a peak in the daily increase in cases on the $(j + 1)$-th day in the $i$th country.\n",
    "\n",
    "While imperfect, this approach gives a pretty decent result especially with the default value of 7 for `n_adj_entries_avg` and `n_adj_entries_peak`, as shown in figure below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = 'images/peaks.png'>\n",

    "- [`numpy.count_nonzero`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.count_nonzero.html): This function (recursively) counts how many elements in an array (and in sub-arrays thereof) that have non-zero values.\n",
    "- [`numpy.isnan`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.isnan.html): Test element-wise for NaN and return result as a boolean array.\n",
    "- [`numpy.nanmean`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.nanmean.html): Compute the arithmetic mean along the specified axis, ignoring NaNs. Returns the average of the array elements. The average is taken over the flattened array by default, otherwise over the specified axis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your implementation should not involve any iteration, including `map` and `filter`, recursion, or any iterative approaches like for-loops.\n",
