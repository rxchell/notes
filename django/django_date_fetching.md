Data structure
```
{
    "date": "2024-12-02",
    "datasets": [
        {
            "timestamp": "2024-12-02T04:23:35.338000",
            "processed_data": {
                "light_source_rec_d1": [...],
                "absorption_rec_d3": [...],
                "recovered_spec_d1-d3": [...]
            }
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

- I would like to get data starting from a specific date and its start time, and ending at a date and its end time.
